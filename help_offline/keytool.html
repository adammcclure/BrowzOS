<h1>keytool - Key and Certificate Management Tool</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Manages a keystore (database) of private keys and their associated X.509 
  certificate chains authenticating the corresponding public keys. Also manages 
  certificates from trusted entities. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
  <pre><strong>keytool</strong> [ <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#Commands">commands</a> ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>keytool</b> is a key and certificate management utility. It enables 
  users to administer their own public/private key pairs and associated 
  certificates for use in self-authentication (where the user authenticates 
  himself/herself to other users/services) or data integrity and authentication 
  services, using digital signatures. It also allows users to cache the public 
  keys (in the form of certificates) of their communicating peers. </p>
  <p>A <i>certificate</i> is a digitally signed statement from one entity 
  (person, company, etc.), saying that the public key (and some other 
  information) of some other entity has a particular value. (See
  <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#Certificates">
  Certificates</a>.) When data is digitally signed, the signature can be 
  verified to check the data integrity and authenticity. <i>Integrity</i> means 
  that the data has not been modified or tampered with, and <i>authenticity</i> 
  means the data indeed comes from whoever claims to have created and signed it.
  </p>
  <p><b>keytool</b> stores the keys and certificates in a so-called <i>keystore</i>. 
  The default
  <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#KeystoreImplementation">
  keystore implementation</a> implements the keystore as a file. It protects 
  private keys with a password. </p>
  <p>The
  <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html">
  <b>jarsigner</b></a> tool uses information from a keystore to generate or 
  verify digital signatures for Java ARchive (JAR) files. (A JAR file packages 
  class files, images, sounds, and/or other digital data in a single file). <b>
  jarsigner</b> verifies the digital signature of a JAR file, using the 
  certificate that comes with it (it is included in the signature block file of 
  the JAR file), and then checks whether or not the public key of that 
  certificate is &quot;trusted&quot;, i.e., is contained in the specified keystore. </p>
  <p>Please note: the <b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b> tools completely 
  replace the <b>javakey</b> tool provided in JDK 1.1. These new tools provide 
  more features than <b>javakey</b>, including the ability to protect the 
  keystore and private keys with passwords, and the ability to verify signatures 
  in addition to generating them. The new keystore architecture replaces the 
  identity database that <b>javakey</b> created and managed. It is possible to 
  import the information from an identity database into a keystore, via the
  <code>-identitydb</code> <b>keytool</b> command. </p>
  <h3>Keystore Entries</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are two different types of entries in a keystore: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>key entries</b> - each holds very sensitive cryptographic key 
      information, which is stored in a protected format to prevent unauthorized 
      access. Typically, a key stored in this type of entry is a secret key, or 
      a private key accompanied by the
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#CertChains">
      certificate &quot;chain&quot;</a> for the corresponding public key. The <b>keytool</b> 
      and <b>jarsigner</b> tools only handle the latter type of entry, that is 
      private keys and their associated certificate chains.<p>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>trusted certificate entries</b> - each contains a single public key 
      certificate belonging to another party. It is called a &quot;trusted 
      certificate&quot; because the keystore owner trusts that the public key in the 
      certificate indeed belongs to the identity identified by the &quot;subject&quot; 
      (owner) of the certificate. The issuer of the certificate vouches for 
      this, by signing the certificate. </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Keystore Aliases</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>All keystore entries (key and trusted certificate entries) are accessed 
    via unique <i>aliases</i>. Aliases are case-insensitive; the aliases <code>
    Hugo</code> and <code>hugo</code> would refer to the same keystore entry.
    </p>
    <p>An alias is specified when you add an entity to the keystore using the
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#genkeyCmd">
    -genkey</a> command to generate a key pair (public and private key) or the
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#importCmd">
    -import</a> command to add a certificate or certificate chain to the list of 
    trusted certificates. Subsequent <b>keytool</b> commands must use this same 
    alias to refer to the entity. </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you use the alias <tt>duke</tt> to generate a new 
    public/private key pair and wrap the public key into a self-signed 
    certificate (see
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#CertChains">
    Certificate Chains</a>) via the following command: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -genkey -alias duke -keypass dukekeypasswd
</pre>
    <p>This specifies an inital password of &quot;dukekeypasswd&quot; required by 
    subsequent commands to access the private key assocated with the alias <code>
    duke</code>. If you later want to change duke's private key password, you 
    use a command like the following: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -keypasswd -alias duke -keypass dukekeypasswd -new newpass
</pre>
    <p>This changes the password from &quot;dukekeypasswd&quot; to &quot;newpass&quot;. </p>
    <p>Please note: A password should not actually be specified on a command 
    line or in a script unless it is for testing purposes, or you are on a 
    secure system. If you don't specify a required password option on a command 
    line, you will be prompted for it. When typing in a password at the password 
    prompt, the password is currently echoed (displayed exactly as typed), so be 
    careful not to type it in front of anyone. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="KeystoreLoc">Keystore Location</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Each <b>keytool</b> command has a <code>-keystore</code> option for 
    specifying the name and location of the persistent keystore file for the 
    keystore managed by <b>keytool</b>. The keystore is by default stored in a 
    file named <i>.keystore</i> in the user's home directory, as determined by 
    the &quot;user.home&quot; system property. Given user name <i>uName</i>, the &quot;user.home&quot; 
    property value defaults to </p>
    <pre>C:\Winnt\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows NT systems
C:\Windows\Profiles\uName on multi-user Windows 95 systems
C:\Windows on single-user Windows 95 systems
</pre>
    <p>Thus, if the user name is &quot;cathy&quot;, &quot;user.home&quot; defaults to </p>
    <pre>C:\Winnt\Profiles\cathy on multi-user Windows NT systems
C:\Windows\Profiles\cathy on multi-user Windows 95 systems
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Keystore Creation</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A keystore is created whenever you use a
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#genkeyCmd">
    -genkey</a>,
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#importCmd">
    -import</a>, or
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#identitydbCmd">
    -identitydb</a> command to add data to a keystore that doesn't yet exist.
    </p>
    <p>More specifically, if you specify, in the <code>-keystore</code> option, 
    a keystore that doesn't yet exist, that keystore will be created. </p>
    <p>If you don't specify a <code>-keystore</code> option, the default 
    keystore is a file named <code>.keystore</code> in your home directory. If 
    that file does not yet exist, it will be created. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="KeystoreImplementation">Keystore Implementation</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The <code>KeyStore</code> class provided in the <code>java.security</code> 
    package supplies well-defined interfaces to access and modify the 
    information in a keystore. It is possible for there to be multiple different 
    concrete implementations, where each implementation is that for a particular
    <i>type</i> of keystore. </p>
    <p>Currently, two command-line tools (<b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b>) 
    and a GUI-based tool named <b>Policy Tool</b> make use of keystore 
    implementations. Since <code>KeyStore</code> is publicly available, JDK 
    users can write additional security applications that use it. </p>
    <p>There is a built-in default implementation, provided by Sun Microsystems. 
    It implements the keystore as a file, utilizing a proprietary keystore type 
    (format) named &quot;JKS&quot;. It protects each private key with its individual 
    password, and also protects the integrity of the entire keystore with a 
    (possibly different) password. </p>
    <p>Keystore implementations are provider-based. More specifically, the 
    application interfaces supplied by <code>KeyStore</code> are implemented in 
    terms of a &quot;Service Provider Interface&quot; (SPI). That is, there is a 
    corresponding abstract <code>KeystoreSpi</code> class, also in the <code>
    java.security</code> package, which defines the Service Provider Interface 
    methods that &quot;providers&quot; must implement. (The term &quot;provider&quot; refers to a 
    package or a set of packages that supply a concrete implementation of a 
    subset of services that can be accessed by the Java Security API.) Thus, to 
    provide a keystore implementation, clients must implement a &quot;provider&quot; and 
    supply a KeystoreSpi subclass implementation, as described in
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/guide/security/HowToImplAProvider.html">
    How to Implement a Provider for the Java Cryptography Architecture</a>. </p>
    <p>Applications can choose different <i>types</i> of keystore 
    implementations from different providers, using the &quot;getInstance&quot; factory 
    method supplied in the <code>KeyStore</code> class. A keystore type defines 
    the storage and data format of the keystore information, and the algorithms 
    used to protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity of the 
    keystore itself. Keystore implementations of different types are not 
    compatible. </p>
    <p><b>keytool</b> works on any file-based keystore implementation. (It 
    treats the keytore location that is passed to it at the command line as a 
    filename and converts it to a FileInputStream, from which it loads the 
    keystore information.) The <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>policytool</b> tools, on 
    the other hand, can read a keystore from any location that can be specified 
    using a URL. </p>
    <p>For <b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b>, you can specify a keystore type 
    at the command line, via the <i>-storetype</i> option. For <b>Policy Tool</b>, 
    you can specify a keystore type via the &quot;Change Keystore&quot; command in the 
    Edit menu. </p>
    <p>If you don't explicitly specify a keystore type, the tools choose a 
    keystore implementation based simply on the value of the <code>keystore.type</code> 
    property specified in the security properties file. The security properties 
    file is called <tt>java.security</tt>, and it resides in the JDK security 
    properties directory, <code><i>java.home</i>\lib\security</code>, where <i>
    java.home</i> is the runtime environment's directory (the <tt>jre</tt> 
    directory in the SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime 
    Environment). </p>
    <p>Each tool gets the <code>keystore.type</code> value and then examines all 
    the currently-installed providers until it finds one that implements 
    keystores of that type. It then uses the keystore implementation from that 
    provider. </p>
    <p>The <code>KeyStore</code> class defines a static method named <code>
    getDefaultType</code> that lets applications and applets retrieve the value 
    of the <code>keystore.type</code> property. The following line of code 
    creates an instance of the default keystore type (as specified in the <code>
    keystore.type</code> property): </p>
    <pre>    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
</pre>
    <p>The default keystore type is &quot;jks&quot; (the proprietary type of the keystore 
    implementation provided by Sun). This is specified by the following line in 
    the security properties file: </p>
    <pre>    keystore.type=jks
</pre>
    <p>To have the tools utilize a keystore implementation other than the 
    default, you can change that line to specify a different keystore type. </p>
    <p>For example, if you have a provider package that supplies a keystore 
    implementation for a keystore type called &quot;pkcs12&quot;, change the line to </p>
    <pre>    keystore.type=pkcs12
</pre>
    <p>Note: case doesn't matter in keystore type designations. For example, &quot;JKS&quot; 
    would be considered the same as &quot;jks&quot;. </p>

  <h3><a name="DefaultAlgs">Supported Algorithms and Key Sizes</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>keytool</b> allows users to specify any key pair generation and 
    signature algorithm supplied by any of the registered cryptographic service 
    providers. That is, the <i>keyalg</i> and <i>sigalg</i> options for various 
    commands must be supported by a provider implementation. The default key 
    pair generation algorithm is &quot;DSA&quot;. The signature algorithm is derived from 
    the algorithm of the underlying private key: If the underlying private key 
    is of type &quot;DSA&quot;, the default signature algorithm is &quot;SHA1withDSA&quot;, and if 
    the underlying private key is of type &quot;RSA&quot;, the default signature algorithm 
    is &quot;MD5withRSA&quot;. </p>
    <p>When generating a DSA key pair, the key size must be in the range from 
    512 to 1024 bits, and must be a multiple of 64. The default key size for any 
    algorithm is 1024 bits. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="Certificates">Certificates</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A <b>certificate</b> (also known as a <b>public-key certificate</b>) is a 
    digitally signed statement from one entity (the <i>issuer</i>), saying that 
    the public key (and some other information) of another entity (the <i>
    subject</i>) has some specific value. </p>
    <p>Let us expand on some of the key terms used in this sentence: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Public Keys</i> </dt>
      <dd>These are numbers associated with a particular entity, and are 
      intended to be known to everyone who needs to have trusted interactions 
      with that entity. Public keys are used to verify signatures. </dd>
      <dt><i>Digitally Signed</i> </dt>
      <dd>If some data is <i>digitally signed</i> it has been stored with the 
      &quot;identity&quot; of an entity, and a signature that proves that entity knows 
      about the data. The data is rendered unforgeable by signing with the 
      entity's private key. </dd>
      <dt><i>Identity</i> </dt>
      <dd>A known way of addressing an entity. In some systems the identity is 
      the public key, in others it can be anything from a Unix UID to an Email 
      address to an X.509 Distinguished Name. </dd>
      <dt><i>Signature</i> </dt>
      <dd>A signature is computed over some data using the private key of an 
      entity (the <i>signer</i>, which in the case of a certificate is also 
      known as the <i>issuer</i>). </dd>
      <dt><i>Private Keys</i> </dt>
      <dd>These are numbers, each of which is supposed to be known only to the 
      particular entity whose private key it is (that is, it's supposed to be 
      kept secret). Private and public keys exist in pairs in all public key 
      cryptography systems (also referred to as &quot;public key crypto systems&quot;). In 
      a typical public key crypto system, such as DSA, a private key corresponds 
      to exactly one public key. Private keys are used to compute signatures.
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Entity</i> </dt>
      <dd>An entity is a person, organization, program, computer, business, 
      bank, or something else you are trusting to some degree. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Basically, public key cryptography requires access to users' public keys. 
    In a large-scale networked environment it is impossible to guarantee that 
    prior relationships between communicating entities have been established or 
    that a trusted repository exists with all used public keys. Certificates 
    were invented as a solution to this public key distribution problem. Now a
    <i>Certification Authority</i> (CA) can act as a trusted third party. CAs 
    are entities (for example, businesses) that are trusted to sign (issue) 
    certificates for other entities. It is assumed that CAs will only create 
    valid and reliable certificates, as they are bound by legal agreements. 
    There are many public Certification Authorities, such as
    <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a>,
    <a href="http://www.thawte.com">Thawte</a>, <a href="http://www.entrust.com">
    Entrust</a>, and so on. You can also run your own Certification Authority 
    using products such as the Netscape/Microsoft Certificate Servers or the 
    Entrust CA product for your organization. </p>
    <p>Using <b>keytool</b>, it is possible to display, import, and export 
    certificates. It is also possible to generate self-signed certificates. </p>
    <p><b>keytool</b> currently handles X.509 certificates. </p>
    <h3><a name="DName">X.509 Certificates</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The X.509 standard defines what information can go into a certificate, 
      and describes how to write it down (the data format). All X.509 
      certificates have the following data, in addition to the signature: </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Version</b> </dt>
        <dd>This identifies which version of the X.509 standard applies to this 
        certificate, which affects what information can be specified in it. Thus 
        far, three versions are defined. <b>keytool</b> can import and export 
        v1, v2, and v3 certificates. It generates v1 certificates. </dd>
        <dt><b>Serial Number</b> </dt>
        <dd>The entity that created the certificate is responsible for assigning 
        it a serial number to distinguish it from other certificates it issues. 
        This information is used in numerous ways, for example when a 
        certificate is revoked its serial number is placed in a Certificate 
        Revocation List (CRL). </dd>
        <dt><b>Signature Algorithm Identifier</b> </dt>
        <dd>This identifies the algorithm used by the CA to sign the 
        certificate. </dd>
        <dt><b>Issuer Name</b> </dt>

        X.500 Distinguished Name</a> of the entity that signed the certificate. 
        This is normally a CA. Using this certificate implies trusting the 
        entity that signed this certificate. (Note that in some cases, such as
        <i>root or top-level</i> CA certificates, the issuer signs its own 
        certificate.) </dd>
        <dt><b>Validity Period</b> </dt>
        <dd>Each certificate is valid only for a limited amount of time. This 
        period is described by a start date and time and an end date and time, 
        and can be as short as a few seconds or almost as long as a century. The 
        validity period chosen depends on a number of factors, such as the 
        strength of the private key used to sign the certificate or the amount 
        one is willing to pay for a certificate. This is the expected period 
        that entities can rely on the public value, if the associated private 
        key has not been compromised. </dd>
        <dt><b>Subject Name</b> </dt>
        <dd>The name of the entity whose public key the certificate identifies. 
        This name uses the X.500 standard, so it is intended to be unique across 
        the Internet. This is the

        X.500 Distinguished Name</a> (DN) of the entity, for example,
        <pre>    CN=Java Duke, OU=  Division, O=Sun Microsystems Inc, C=US
</pre>
        <p>(These refer to the subject's Common Name, Organizational Unit, 
        Organization, and Country.) </dd>
        <dt><b>Subject Public Key Information</b> </dt>
        <dd>This is the public key of the entity being named, together with an 
        algorithm identifier which specifies which public key crypto system this 
        key belongs to and any associated key parameters. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p><i>X.509 Version 1</i> has been available since 1988, is widely 
      deployed, and is the most generic. </p>
      <p><i>X.509 Version 2</i> introduced the concept of subject and issuer 
      unique identifiers to handle the possibility of reuse of subject and/or 
      issuer names over time. Most certificate profile documents strongly 
      recommend that names not be reused, and that certificates should not make 
      use of unique identifiers. Version 2 certificates are not widely used. </p>
      <p><i>X.509 Version 3</i> is the most recent (1996) and supports the 
      notion of extensions, whereby anyone can define an extension and include 
      it in the certificate. Some common extensions in use today are: <i>
      KeyUsage</i> (limits the use of the keys to particular purposes such as 
      &quot;signing-only&quot;) and <i>AlternativeNames</i> (allows other identities to 
      also be associated with this public key, e.g. DNS names, Email addresses, 
      IP addresses). Extensions can be marked <i>critical</i> to indicate that 
      the extension should be checked and enforced/used. For example, if a 
      certificate has the KeyUsage extension marked critical and set to &quot;keyCertSign&quot; 
      then if this certificate is presented during SSL communication, it should 
      be rejected, as the certificate extension indicates that the associated 
      private key should only be used for signing certificates and not for SSL 
      use. </p>
      <p>All the data in a certificate is encoded using two related standards 
      called ASN.1/DER. <i>Abstract Syntax Notation 1</i> describes data. The <i>
      Definite Encoding Rules</i> describe a single way to store and transfer 
      that data. </p>

    <h4><a name="EncodeCertificate">The Internet RFC 1421 Certificate Encoding 
    Standard</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Certificates are often stored using the printable encoding format 
      defined by the Internet RFC 1421 standard, instead of their binary 
      encoding. This certificate format, also known as &quot;Base 64 encoding&quot;, 
      facilitates exporting certificates to other applications by email or 
      through some other mechanism. </p>
      <p>Certificates read by the <code>-import</code> and <code>-printcert</code> 
      commands can be in either this format or binary encoded. </p>
      <p>The <code>-export</code> command by default outputs a certificate in 
      binary encoding, but will instead output a certificate in the printable 
      encoding format, if the <code>-rfc</code> option is specified. </p>
      <p>The <code>-list</code> command by default prints the MD5 fingerprint of 
      a certificate. If the <code>-v</code> option is specified, the certificate 
      is printed in human-readable format, while if the <code>-rfc</code> option 
      is specified, the certificate is output in the printable encoding format.
      </p>
      <p>In its printable encoding format, the encoded certificate is bounded at 
      the beginning by </p>
      <pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

      <p>and at the end by </p>

    <h3><a name="CertChains">Certificate Chains</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>keytool</b> can create and manage keystore &quot;key&quot; entries that each 
      contain a private key and an associated certificate &quot;chain&quot;. The first 
      certificate in the chain contains the public key corresponding to the 
      private key. </p>
      <p>When keys are first generated (see the
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#genkeyCmd">
      -genkey</a> command), the chain starts off containing a single element, a
      <i>self-signed certificate</i>. A self-signed certificate is one for which 
      the issuer (signer) is the same as the subject (the entity whose public 
      key is being authenticated by the certificate). Whenever the <code>-genkey</code> 
      command is called to generate a new public/private key pair, it also wraps 
      the public key into a self-signed certificate. </p>
      <p>Later, after a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) has been generated 
      (see the
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#certreqCmd">
      -certreq</a> command) and sent to a Certification Authority (CA), the 
      response from the CA is imported (see
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#importCmd">
      -import</a>), and the self-signed certificate is replaced by a chain of 
      certificates. At the bottom of the chain is the certificate (reply) issued 
      by the CA authenticating the subject's public key. The next certificate in 
      the chain is one that authenticates the <i>CA</i>'s public key. </p>
      <p>In many cases, this is a self-signed certificate (that is, a 
      certificate from the CA authenticating its own public key) and the last 
      certificate in the chain. In other cases, the CA may return a chain of 
      certificates. In this case, the bottom certificate in the chain is the 
      same (a certificate signed by the CA, authenticating the public key of the 
      key entry), but the second certificate in the chain is a certificate 
      signed by a <i>different</i> CA, authenticating the public key of the CA 
      you sent the CSR to. Then, the next certificate in the chain will be a 
      certificate authenticating the second CA's key, and so on, until a 
      self-signed &quot;root&quot; certificate is reached. Each certificate in the chain 
      (after the first) thus authenticates the public key of the signer of the 
      previous certificate in the chain. </p>
      <p>Many CAs only return the issued certificate, with no supporting chain, 
      especially when there is a flat hierarchy (no intermediates CAs). In this 
      case, the certificate chain must be established from trusted certificate 
      information already stored in the keystore. </p>
      <p>A different reply format (defined by the PKCS#7 standard) also includes 
      the supporting certificate chain, in addition to the issued certificate. 
      Both reply formats can be handled by <b>keytool</b>. </p>
      <p>The top-level (root) CA certificate is self-signed. However, the trust 
      into the root's public key does not come from the root certificate itself 
      (anybody could generate a self-signed certificate with the distinguished 
      name of say, the VeriSign root CA!), but from other sources like a 
      newspaper. The root CA public key is widely known. The only reason it is 
      stored in a certificate is because this is the format understood by most 
      tools, so the certificate in this case is only used as a &quot;vehicle&quot; to 
      transport the root CA's public key. Before you add the root CA certificate 
      to your keystore, you should view it (using the <code>-printcert</code> 
      option) and compare the displayed fingerprint with the well-known 
      fingerprint (obtained from a newspaper, the root CA's webpage, etc.). </p>

    <h4><a name="ImportCertificate">Importing Certificates</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To import a certificate from a file, use the
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#importCmd">
      -import</a> command, as in </p>
      <pre>    keytool -import -alias joe -file jcertfile.cer
</pre>
      <p>This sample command imports the certificate(s) in the file <i>
      jcertfile.cer</i> and stores it in the keystore entry identified by the 
      alias <i>joe</i>. </p>
      <p>You import a certificate for two reasons: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>to add it to the list of trusted certificates, or<p>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>to import a certificate reply received from a CA as the result of 
        submitting a Certificate Signing Request (see the
        <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#certreqCmd">
        -certreq</a> command) to that CA. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Which type of import is intended is indicated by the value of the <code>
      -alias</code> option. If the alias exists in the database, and identifies 
      an entry with a private key, then it is assumed you want to import a 
      certificate reply. <b>keytool</b> checks whether the public key in the 
      certificate reply matches the public key stored with the alias, and exits 
      if they are different. If the alias identifies the other type of keystore 
      entry, the certificate will not be imported. If the alias does not exist, 
      then it will be created and associated with the imported certificate. </p>
      <h4><a name="TrustedCertWarning">WARNING Regarding Importing Trusted 
      Certificates</a></h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>IMPORTANT: Be sure to check a certificate very carefully before 
        importing it as a trusted certificate! </p>
        <p>View it first (using the <code>-printcert</code> command, or the
        <code>-import command</code> without the <code>-noprompt</code> option), 
        and make sure that the displayed certificate fingerprint(s) match the 
        expected ones. For example, suppose someone sends or emails you a 
        certificate, and you put it in a file named <code>/tmp/cert</code>. 
        Before you consider adding the certificate to your list of trusted 
        certificates, you can execute a <code>-printcert</code> command to view 
        its fingerprints, as in </p>
        <pre>  keytool -printcert -file /tmp/cert
    Owner: CN=ll, OU=ll, O=ll, L=ll, S=ll, C=ll
    Issuer: CN=ll, OU=ll, O=ll, L=ll, S=ll, C=ll
    Serial Number: 59092b34
    Valid from: Thu Sep 25 18:01:13 PDT 1997 until: Wed Dec 24 17:01:13 PST 1997
    Certificate Fingerprints:
         MD5:  11:81:AD:92:C8:E5:0E:A2:01:2E:D4:7A:D7:5F:07:6F
         SHA1: 20:B6:17:FA:EF:E5:55:8A:D0:71:1F:E8:D6:9D:C0:37:13:0E:5E:FE
</pre>
        <p>Then call or otherwise contact the person who sent the certificate, 
        and compare the fingerprint(s) that you see with the ones that they 
        show. Only if the fingerprints are equal is it guaranteed that the 
        certificate has not been replaced in transit with somebody else's (for 
        example, an attacker's) certificate. If such an attack took place, and 
        you did not check the certificate before you imported it, you would end 
        up trusting anything the attacker has signed (for example, a JAR file 
        with malicious class files inside). </p>
        <p>Note: it is not required that you execute a <code>-printcert</code> 
        command prior to importing a certificate, since before adding a 
        certificate to the list of trusted certificates in the keystore, the
        <code>-import</code> command prints out the certificate information and 
        prompts you to verify it. You then have the option of aborting the 
        import operation. Note, however, this is only the case if you invoke the
        <code>-import</code> command without the <code>-noprompt</code> option. 
        If the <code>-noprompt</code> option is given, there is no interaction 
        with the user. </p>

      <p>This sample command exports <code>jane</code>'s certificate to the file

      key entry, the command exports the certificate at the bottom of the 
      certificate chain in that keystore entry. This is the certificate that 
      authenticates <code>jane</code>'s public key. </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A <i>self-signed certificate</i> is one for which the issuer (signer) 
      is the same as the subject (the entity whose public key is being

      <p>You may occasionally wish to generate a new self-signed certificate. 
      For example, you may want to use the same key pair under a different

    <li>The options for each command may be provided in any order.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>All items not italicized or in braces or square brackets are required to 
    appear as is.<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Braces surrounding an option generally signify that a
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#OptionDefaults">
    default</a> value will be used if the option is not specified on the command 
    line. Braces are also used around the <code>-v</code>, <code>-rfc</code>, 
    and <code>-J</code> options, which only have meaning if they appear on the 
    command line (that is, they don't have any &quot;default&quot; values other than not 
    existing).<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Brackets surrounding an option signify that the user is prompted for the 
    value(s) if the option is not specified on the command line. (For a <code>-keypass</code> 
    option, if you do not specify the option on the command line, <b>keytool</b> 
    will first attempt to use the keystore password to recover the private key, 
    and if this fails, will then prompt you for the private key password.)<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Items in italics (option values) represent the actual values that must 
    be supplied. For example, here is the format of the <code>-printcert</code> 
    command:
    <pre>  keytool -printcert {-file <i>cert_file</i>} {-v}
</pre>
    <p>When specifying a <code>-printcert</code> command, replace <i>cert_file</i> 
    with the actual file name, as in: </p>

</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Option values must be quoted if they contain a blank (space).<p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The <code>-help</code> command is the default. Thus, the command line

      supplied in a PKCS#7 formatted reply) from the file <i>cert_file</i>, and 
      stores it in the keystore entry identified by <i>alias</i>. If no file is 
      given, the certificate or PKCS#7 reply is read from stdin. <b>keytool</b> 
      can import X.509 v1, v2, and v3 certificates, and PKCS#7 formatted 
      certificate chains consisting of certificates of that type. The data to be 
      imported must be provided either in binary encoding format, or in 
      printable encoding format (also known as Base64 encoding) as defined by 
      the
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#EncodeCertificate">
      Internet RFC 1421 standard</a>. In the latter case, the encoding must be 
      bounded at the beginning by a string that starts with &quot;-----BEGIN&quot;, and 
      bounded at the end by a string that starts with &quot;-----END&quot;.
      <p>When importing a <b>new trusted certificate</b>, <i>alias</i> must not 
      yet exist in the keystore. Before adding the certificate to the keystore,
      <b>keytool</b> tries to verify it by attempting to construct a chain of 
      trust from that certificate to a self-signed certificate (belonging to a 
      root CA), using trusted certificates that are already available in the 
      keystore. </p>
      <p>If the <code>-trustcacerts</code> option has been specified, additional 
      certificates are considered for the chain of trust, namely the 
      certificates in a file named <b>&quot;cacerts&quot;</b>, which resides in the JDK 
      security properties directory, <code><i>java.home</i>\lib\security</code>, 
      where <i>java.home</i> is the runtime environment's directory (the <tt>jre</tt> 
      directory in the SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime 
      Environment). The &quot;cacerts&quot; file represents a system-wide keystore with CA 
      certificates. System administrators can configure and manage that file 
      using <b>keytool</b>, specifying &quot;jks&quot; as the keystore type. The &quot;cacerts&quot; 
      keystore file ships with five VeriSign root CA certificates with the 
      following X.500 distinguished names: </p>
      <pre>1. OU=Class 1 Public Primary Certification Authority, O=&quot;VeriSign, Inc.&quot;,
C=US

2. OU=Class 2 Public Primary Certification Authority, O=&quot;VeriSign,

3. OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority,

4. OU=Class 4 Public Primary Certification
Authority, O=&quot;VeriSign, Inc.&quot;, C=US

5. OU=Secure Server Certification
Authority, O=&quot;RSA Data Security, Inc.&quot;, C=US
</pre>
      <p>The initial password of the &quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file is &quot;changeit&quot;. 
      System administrators should change that password and the default access 
      permission of that file upon installing the JDK. </p>
      <p>If <b>keytool</b> fails to establish a trust path from the certificate 
      to be imported up to a self-signed certificate (either from the keystore 
      or the &quot;cacerts&quot; file), the certificate information is printed out, and 
      the user is prompted to verify it, e.g., by comparing the displayed 
      certificate fingerprints with the fingerprints obtained from some other 
      (trusted) source of information, which might be the certificate owner 
      himself/herself. Be very careful to ensure the certificate is valid prior 
      to importing it as a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate! -- see
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#TrustedCertWarning">
      WARNING Regarding Importing Trusted Certificates</a>. The user then has 
      the option of aborting the import operation. If the <code>-noprompt</code> 
      option is given, however, there will be no interaction with the user. </p>
      <p>When importing a <b>certificate reply</b>, the certificate reply is 
      validated using trusted certificates from the keystore, and optionally 
      using the certificates configured in the &quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file (if the
      <code>-trustcacerts</code> option was specified). </p>
      <p>If the reply is a single X.509 certificate, <b>keytool</b> attempts to 
      establish a trust chain, starting at the certificate reply and ending at a 
      self-signed certificate (belonging to a root CA). The certificate reply 
      and the hierarchy of certificates used to authenticate the certificate 
      reply form the new certificate chain of <i>alias</i>. </p>
      <p>If the reply is a PKCS#7 formatted certificate chain, the chain is 
      first ordered (with the user certificate first and the self-signed root CA 
      certificate last), before <b>keytool</b> attempts to match the root CA 
      certificate provided in the reply with any of the trusted certificates in 
      the keystore or the &quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file (if the <code>-trustcacerts</code> 
      option was specified). If no match can be found, the information of the 
      root CA certificate is printed out, and the user is prompted to verify it, 
      e.g., by comparing the displayed certificate fingerprints with the 
      fingerprints obtained from some other (trusted) source of information, 
      which might be the root CA itself. The user then has the option of 
      aborting the import operation. If the <code>-noprompt</code> option is 
      given, however, there will be no interaction with the user. </p>
      <p>The new certificate chain of <i>alias</i> replaces the old certificate 
      chain associated with this entry. The old chain can only be replaced if a 
      valid <i>keypass</i>, the password used to protect the private key of the

  <p>Suppose you want to create a keystore for managing your public/private key 
  pair and certificates from entities you trust. </p>
  <h3>Generating Your Key Pair</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The first thing you need to do is create a keystore and generate the key 
    pair. You could use a command such as the following: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -genkey -dname &quot;cn=Mark Jones, ou=JavaSoft, o=Sun, c=US&quot; 
      -alias business -keypass kpi135 -keystore C:\working\mykeystore 
      -storepass ab987c -validity 180
</pre>
    <p>(Please note: This must be typed as a single line. Multiple lines are 
    used in the examples just for legibility purposes.) </p>
    <p>This command creates the keystore named &quot;mykeystore&quot; in the &quot;working&quot; 
    directory on the C drive (assuming it doesn't already exist), and assigns it 
    the password &quot;ab987c&quot;. It generates a public/private key pair for the entity 
    whose &quot;distinguished name&quot; has a common name of &quot;Mark Jones&quot;, organizational 
    unit of &quot;JavaSoft&quot;, organization of &quot;Sun&quot; and two-letter country code of 
    &quot;US&quot;. It uses the default &quot;DSA&quot; key generation algorithm to create the keys, 
    both 1024 bits long. </p>
    <p>It creates a self-signed certificate (using the default &quot;SHA1withDSA&quot; 
    signature algorithm) that includes the public key and the distinguished name 
    information. This certificate will be valid for 180 days, and is associated 
    with the private key in a keystore entry referred to by the alias 
    &quot;business&quot;. The private key is assigned the password &quot;kpi135&quot;. </p>
    <p>The command could be significantly shorter if option defaults were 
    accepted. As a matter of fact, no options are required; defaults are used 
    for unspecified options that have default values, and you are prompted for 
    any required values. Thus, you could simply have the following: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -genkey 
</pre>
    <p>In this case, a keystore entry with alias &quot;mykey&quot; is created, with a 
    newly-generated key pair and a certificate that is valid for 90 days. This 
    entry is placed in the keystore named &quot;.keystore&quot; in your home directory. 
    (The keystore is created if it doesn't already exist.) You will be prompted 
    for the distinguished name information, the keystore password, and the 
    private key password. </p>
    <p>The rest of the examples assume you executed the <code>-genkey</code> 
    command without options specified, and that you responded to the prompts 
    with values equal to those given in the first <code>-genkey</code> command, 
    above (a private key password of &quot;kpi135&quot;, etc.) </p>

  <h3>Requesting a Signed Certificate from a Certification Authority</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>So far all we've got is a self-signed certificate. A certificate is more 
    likely to be trusted by others if it is signed by a Certification Authority 
    (CA). To get such a signature, you first generate a Certificate Signing 
    Request (CSR), via the following: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -certreq -file MarkJ.csr
</pre>
    <p>This creates a CSR (for the entity identified by the default alias &quot;mykey&quot;) 
    and puts the request in the file named &quot;MarkJ.csr&quot;. Submit this file to a 
    CA, such as VeriSign, Inc. The CA will authenticate you, the requestor 
    (usually off-line), and then will return a certificate, signed by them, 
    authenticating your public key. (In some cases, they will actually return a 
    chain of certificates, each one authenticating the public key of the signer 
    of the previous certificate in the chain.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Importing a Certificate for the CA</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You need to replace your self-signed certificate with a certificate 
    chain, where each certificate in the chain authenticates the public key of 
    the signer of the previous certificate in the chain, up to a &quot;root&quot; CA. </p>
    <p>Before you import the certificate reply from a CA, you need one or more 
    &quot;trusted certificates&quot; in your keystore or in the <code>cacerts</code> 
    keystore file (which is described in
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html#importCmd">
    import command</a>): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the certificate reply is a certificate chain, you just need the top 
      certificate of the chain (that is, the &quot;root&quot; CA certificate 
      authenticating that CA's public key).<p>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If the certificate reply is a single certificate, you need a 
      certificate for the issuing CA (the one that signed it), and if that 
      certificate is not self-signed, you need a certificate for its signer, and 
      so on, up to a self-signed &quot;root&quot; CA certificate. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The &quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file ships with five VeriSign root CA 
    certificates, so you probably won't need to import a VeriSign certificate as 
    a trusted certificate in your keystore. But if you request a signed 
    certificate from a different CA, and a certificate authenticating that CA's 
    public key hasn't been added to &quot;cacerts&quot;, you will need to import a 
    certificate from the CA as a &quot;trusted certificate&quot;. </p>
    <p>A certificate from a CA is usually either self-signed, or signed by 
    another CA (in which case you also need a certificate authenticating that 
    CA's public key). Suppose company ABC, Inc., is a CA, and you obtain a file 
    named &quot;ABCCA.cer&quot; that is purportedly a self-signed certificate from ABC, 
    authenticating that CA's public key. </p>
    <p>Be very careful to ensure the certificate is valid prior to importing it 
    as a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate! View it first (using the <b>keytool</b> <code>-printcert</code> 
    command, or the <b>keytool</b> <code>-import</code> command without the
    <code>-noprompt</code> option), and make sure that the displayed certificate 
    fingerprint(s) match the expected ones. You can call the person who sent the 
    certificate, and compare the fingerprint(s) that you see with the ones that 
    they show (or that a secure public key repository shows). Only if the 
    fingerprints are equal is it guaranteed that the certificate has not been 
    replaced in transit with somebody else's (for example, an attacker's) 
    certificate. If such an attack took place, and you did not check the 
    certificate before you imported it, you would end up trusting anything the 
    attacker has signed. </p>
    <p>If you trust that the certificate is valid, then you can add it to your 
    keystore via the following: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -import -alias abc -file ABCCA.cer
</pre>
    <p>This creates a &quot;trusted certificate&quot; entry in the keystore, with the data 
    from the file &quot;ABCCA.cer&quot;, and assigns the alias &quot;abc&quot; to the entry. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Importing the Certificate Reply from the CA</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Once you've imported a certificate authenticating the public key of the 
    CA you submitted your certificate signing request to (or there's already 
    such a certificate in the &quot;cacerts&quot; file), you can import the certificate 
    reply and thereby replace your self-signed certificate with a certificate 
    chain. This chain is the one returned by the CA in response to your request 
    (if the CA reply is a chain), or one constructed (if the CA reply is a 
    single certificate) using the certificate reply and trusted certificates 
    that are already available in the keystore where you import the reply or in 
    the &quot;cacerts&quot; keystore file. </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you sent your certificate signing request to 
    VeriSign. You can then import the reply via the following, which assumes the 
    returned certificate is named &quot;VSMarkJ.cer&quot;: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -import -trustcacerts -file VSMarkJ.cer
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Exporting a Certificate Authenticating Your Public Key</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose you have used the
    <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html">
    jarsigner</a> tool to sign a Java ARchive (JAR) file. Clients that want to 
    use the file will want to authenticate your signature. </p>
    <p>One way they can do this is by first importing your public key 
    certificate into their keystore as a &quot;trusted&quot; entry. You can export the 
    certificate and supply it to your clients. As an example, you can copy your 
    certificate to a file named <code>MJ.cer</code> via the following, assuming 
    the entry is aliased by &quot;mykey&quot;: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -export -alias mykey -file MJ.cer
</pre>
    <p>Given that certificate, and the signed JAR file, a client can use the <b>
    jarsigner</b> tool to authenticate your signature. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Changing Your Distinguished Name but Keeping your Key Pair</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose your distinguished name changes, for example because you have 
    changed departments or moved to a different city. If desired, you may still 
    use the public/private key pair you've previously used, and yet update your 
    distinguished name. For example, suppose your name is Susan Miller, and you 
    created your initial key entry with the alias <code>sMiller</code> and the 
    distinguished name </p>
    <pre>  &quot;cn=Susan Miller, ou=Finance Department, o=BlueSoft, c=us&quot;
</pre>
    <p>Suppose you change from the Finance Department to the Accounting 
    Department. You can still use the previously-generated public/private key 
    pair and yet update your distinguished name by doing the following. First, 
    copy (clone) your key entry: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -keyclone -alias sMiller -dest sMillerNew
</pre>
    <p>(This prompts for the store password and for the initial and destination 
    private key passwords, since they aren't provided at the command line.) Now 
    you need to change the certificate chain associated with the copy, so that 
    the first certificate in the chain uses your different distinguished name. 
    Start by generating a self-signed certificate with the appropriate name: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -selfcert -alias sMillerNew
      -dname &quot;cn=Susan Miller, ou=Accounting Department, o=BlueSoft, c=us&quot;
</pre>
    <p>Then generate a Certificate Signing Request based on the information in 
    this new certificate: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -certreq -alias sMillerNew
</pre>
    <p>When you get the CA certificate reply, import it: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -import -alias sMillerNew -file VSSMillerNew.cer
</pre>
    <p>After importing the certificate reply, you may want to remove the initial 
    key entry that used your old distinguished name: </p>
    <pre>    keytool -delete -alias sMiller
</pre>
